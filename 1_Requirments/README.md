# **LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

## INTRODUCTION:

Library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.

The project titled Library Management System is Library Management software for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library. The project “Library Management System” is developed in C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, and updating new information, searching books and members and return books.

This project “LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” gives us the complete information about the library. We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library. We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library. In this project we can maintain the late fine of students who returns the issued books after the due date.

## OBJECTIVES:
a) To build a system that can receive input and generate automatically output in easy way and short time.

b) To build a monitoring system that is able to monitor and manage all library operations efficiently.

c) Give an opportunity to librarians to reduce mistakes that always happen during manual method.

d) To store properly the library items in order to maintain their security.

e) To enter and preserve details of the various issues and keep a track on their returns.

## **BENEFITS:**
a) Record Maintenance.

b) Web-Based Solution.

c) Saves Time and Cost.

d) Secure and Reliable.

e) Increases Efficiency.

f) Simple and Easy to Use.

## **4W'S and 1H:**

### Who
This Library Management System is an application is used by all the students, and staff who are having id's.

### What:
Library Management Systems is software that helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new books & record books borrowed by the members, with the respective submission dates.

### When:
This Library Management System is very useful when there are large no of readers visit library to return, renewal, or take books. It is very tedious to enter the records manually so here this project come into handy.

### Where:
The Library management system is nowadays essential for schools, colleges, private libraries, and other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of books issuing and returning for renewal.

### How:
This project is implemented to do the book issuing, retunrn, or renewal purpose by entering the student or faculty id as input.

## **Swot Analysis:**

### Strengths:
a) Simple & Easy to Use.

b) Increased Library Engagement.

c) Efficient Cloud Data Management.

d) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 

e) Mobile Access.

### Weakness:
a) The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.

b) Costly and Expensive.

c) Complicated to operate.

d) Online Systems require high-speed internet connectivity.

e) Risk of computer virus.

## Opportunities:
The LMS leaks outward into new spaces, spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management and so forth. Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing move towards closed platforms (like Facebook, for example) and proprietary ecosystems (like Apple), libraries will be required tonavigate these different spaces and ecosystems.

### Threats:
Libraries now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some libraries don’t have the right data encryption practices in place. This can often lead to lost data and sometimes, the data easily obtainable by criminals.
